Hey there stranger, seems like you really shook up this old place good.
I hear that Ruby's got you out running errands.
Well good for you! Hey, if you want to make yourself useful later on, I might be able to scratch up some chores that need doing.
Well isn't that just like old Ruby. 'Don't hold grudges, just get things done.' Just like she always said. Come back later and I ought to be able to find parts of the community for you to service.
