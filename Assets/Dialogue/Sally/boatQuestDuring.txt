Hey there kid.
So, you gather up all the wood we need yet?
Well, ain't this just a mess of wood you've gathered here? Now let's whip us up a good ol' raft outta this stuff! There! Now, just hop on when you're ready and follow me out onto the water, kiddo! This is just the first part of our mission!
I ain't got no wood 'round these parts or nuthin', kid. We can’t make you a raft 'till you get the goods!
