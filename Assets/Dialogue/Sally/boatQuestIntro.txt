Listen, kid, I really need your help fer something, but I can't give you any infermation right now.
So, you in?
Awesome. So I'm gonna need your help out on the Lake. Now, to get you out there, you're gonna need a boat of some kind. Gather up some wood and meet me over by the dock. We should be able to slap together some kinda raft fer you.
I'm sorry I can't tell you what's what, but I do really need your help on this, stranger! Please come by soon, fer Ruby if nuthin' else.
