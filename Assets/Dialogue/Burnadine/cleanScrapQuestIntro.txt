Hello, dear!
Have you come to help an old stool, do your good deed for the day?
Well, there's all of your ship debris that planted itself in my fields. It would be ever so kind of you to remove it for me. Take this shovel.
Well, hurry on back, dearie. You wouldn't make me do this all this heavy lifting by my little-old-self, would you?
