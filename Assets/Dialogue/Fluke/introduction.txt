You did a thorough job of busting up of quiet little town, that was awfully unkind of you.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Awfully decent of you to say so, but that doesn't make up for the hole in my roof. Come back later and I'll set you to patching it.
Doesn't rightly matter what I think, what matters is that you fix what you broke! Come back later and you can start making amends with my roof.
