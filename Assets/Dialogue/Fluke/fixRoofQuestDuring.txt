Hey there, youngin'!
Have you gotten that dang hole covered up yet?
Thanks, youngin'! I'm rather impressed with all your hard work. Maybe you're not so bad as I thought. Let me open the store for you. By the way, if you find too much money weighing down your pockets, I have a fancy new spaceship wing you could buy. You might recognize it.
Get to it, youngin'! I ain’t selling you nothin' 'till you fix my roof!
