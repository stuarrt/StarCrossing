Hey there!
Okay, little one, it's time to put up some of my advertisements all over town. My new items haven't sold too well lately.
Now that's the kind of enthusiasm for work I wish my daughter had! I'll let you get to it then.
I don't see what’s more important than advertising, but if you insist. Just don't go leavin' me high and dry with these, Ya hear?
