Hey there youngin'!
Listen, it's gotten awfully hot lately. If you would be so kind as to fetch me some, that is, a LOT of water. I'll make it worth your while.
Bless your heart, off-worlder. Just fill up the tank I'll set up in the corner of the store.
Please do reconsider, youngin'. I don't rightly know how long I can last like this.
