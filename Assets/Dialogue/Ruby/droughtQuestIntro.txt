Listen, I need your help with something. I have been receiving reports from some of the townsfolk that the lake shore has receded from its usual level and that a massive drought is imminent.
I need you to go down to the Lake and investigate these claims.
Just get it done, kid.
I don't think these wild claims have much merit either, but see if you can find time to help me placate my father's constituents soon.
