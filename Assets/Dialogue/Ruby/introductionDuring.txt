Oh, it's you.
Have you finished with the task I set you?
Well, at least I don’t have to charge you with a killing. I hereby sentence you to thirty days of community service for your destructive acts of vandalism and reckless endangerment of the town.
Well, hurry up, criminal. Once your report is complete, I can sentence you for your crimes against our town.
