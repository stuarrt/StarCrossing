Hey you, you're the new guy aren't you? You look like someone who's willing to help others.
The wind blew away my favorite poster of Wallace the Frog ghost. Think you can help?
Thank you stranger, I knew just by looking at you that you were a kind hearted person. The poster landed on the top of the Observatory telescope, southwest from here.
I guess you aren't the person I thought you'd be.
Maybe? What kind of response is that? Don't you wanna help me out?
