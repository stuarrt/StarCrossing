Hello, my child.
Have you finished your great work, my loyal missionary?
Do not worry, child. Soon they will all see our light and their wickedness shall burn away in the flames of our righteousness.
Then return to your task with haste, my child! The souls of the others will not save themselves; quite the opposite, in fact!
