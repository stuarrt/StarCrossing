Good day, my child.
Have you finished God's work yet?
That's all right, young acolyte. They will all be brought before the light at some point. Here, a reward for your devotion to the church.
Be careful, or your sinful sloth shall lead you away from the burning path of purest light. You must make sure that our flock is properly informed.
