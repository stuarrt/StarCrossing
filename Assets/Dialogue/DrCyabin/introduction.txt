Good evening.
So you're the traveler whose ship has run amok in our town.
Hmm, quite. Well, I shouldn't keep you, Ruby will want to hear about the state of our little town posthaste!
Intriguing! I will look into the matter for you. Now, pop off and check on the rest of the town. The smart money says, "Don't keep Ruby waiting!"
