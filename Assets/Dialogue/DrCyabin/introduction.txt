Good evening.
So you're the traveler whose ship has run amok in our town.
You must come and see me up at the Observatory as soon as you report back to Ruby! I have grave news, but it is not wise to keep her waiting.
I may know why you lost control. You must come and see me as soon as you finish with Ruby!
