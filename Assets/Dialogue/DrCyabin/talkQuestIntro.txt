Come quickly! 
I have grave news for you, up at the Observatory!
I have found the reason for your untimely impact with our town. My sensors have picked up a powerful gravity well focused on our planet. It must have pulled you from the sky when it started. I need you to go and let Ruby know about this.
You don't understand! This planet is in terrible danger!
