Oh good, you're back.
Did you inform Ruby yet of our dire predicament?
That isn't good, but she will learn soon enough. As the planet approaches the sun, things around here will begin to change for the worse in a big way. Droughts, fires, landslides, and who knows what else.
Don't dally here, my young space traveler! Ruby must be informed about this terrible situation.
