Ahhh, welcome back traveler.
I'm in need of your help, now that you have finished running errands for Ruby.
I'm in need of a fossil for my research. I believe I last saw one near Wallace's house. The one shaped like a frog.
There's a fossil near that frog-like house. If possible, could you retreive it for me? Thanks!
