Hey! It's the new one on board!
You come by to check out my new project idea?
Well, I've finished the designs for a prototype grappling gun. But one problem: some of the materials I need are pretty hard to come by. Enter you - I need you to go around town and collect the scrap that your impeccable landing left scattered around. If you can’t think of places to look, talk to Khet and Burnadine.
Well, come on by as soon as you can! I can't hold off on my tech genius forever. Eventually it'll bust out and you'll be left to shop up the scraps.
