You again...
Well? Have you finished your community service for the day?
Well, I guess you did good, kid. Here, some pay for the time you wasted doing this.
Listen, kid, as much as I enjoy your wasting time during work hours,money is time and time is fleeting. Get your work done and then come back to talk to me.
