So, it's you again... whoopie...
Well don't just stand there. Help me with all of this drudgery.
That's the spirit, fly-by. Just walk around and grab all of the space junk you can see. There also might be some lodged in the ground, so use a shovel if you have one.
Well, that just figures. Make sure you come back around soon. If you make me clean up all of your mess around here, I won't be happy.
