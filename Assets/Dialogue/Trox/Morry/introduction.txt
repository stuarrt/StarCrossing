My god, the town we have spent so long building is in shambles because of you! 
Exactly how do you expect to repent for this transgression?
Not so fast! You need to come back here after finishing with Ruby. There is much damage to my and my sister's property for you to atone for. Now be gone.
No one was hurt here, but once you finish Ruby's bidding there are some things that you can do around here to make up for the calamity you have brought upon us.
