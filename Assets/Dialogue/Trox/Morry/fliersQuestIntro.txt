Hello there, wanderer.
I have another holy task for you. I need you to take these fliers for the church service I am organizing.
Excellent, my child. Please make haste to bring the word of the church to the good people of our town.
Such blasphemy! I do hope you will change your heathen ways and embrace the light of the church, young one.
