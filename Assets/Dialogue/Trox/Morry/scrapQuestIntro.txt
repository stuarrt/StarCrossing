My goodness, this mess is quite a sight, you heathen!
I do pray that you are here to reconcile this affront to my property.
Bless you, traveler. Clean this up at once and return to me, posthaste!
Blasphemous! You cannot just make a mess of our fine town and think you can just stand around and watch it go to hell!
