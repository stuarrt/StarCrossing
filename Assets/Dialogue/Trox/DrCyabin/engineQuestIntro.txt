I'm getting an even higher resonance response out of the Pinpoint Metallogram Sensor. This can only mean that there is some large foreign metallic object in the Lake region.
Strange, it seems to be outputting energy of some kind. You should go take a look.
Well, Sally might be able to help you out with that. She's always out on the Lake, night or day and rain or shine. Try to get out there before someone else grabs this object!
Well if you change your mind, come back. That object won't be there forever, child.
