Hello, my child.
Have you found your way out to the strange object in the Lake?
Wonderful, traveler, simply wonderful. Your ship will need an engine if we are to have a way off this world.
Well do hurry along then, traveler! These strange energy output readings from the object suggest something not of the natural world.
