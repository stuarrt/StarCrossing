My word! Look at all of these readings! I am getting a high response out of the Pinpoint Metallogram Sensor. This can only mean that some foreign metallic object has appeared in the Forest!
You should go and take a look. You might even recognize what you find, space traveler.
Excellent! I'll stay here and go over these numbers some more while you go to the Forest.
Well, traveler, I do hope that you return soon. Who knows how long that object will remain in one spot.
