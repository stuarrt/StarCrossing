Hey, kid! I figured out somethin' that I don't wanna do.
I'm running out of Wonderous Winky Soda so I want you to take this money and go get me some more from the Floundry. So, you in?
Well, here's some money... Get back as fast as you can so I can get slimin'!
Ha! Dang, kid, you’re good. Tell you what, if you come back later and do it, I'll throw in some of my patented, small-batch Super Sticky Slug Slime.
