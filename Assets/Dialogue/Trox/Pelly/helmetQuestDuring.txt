Hello, traveler.
Have you procured a device to allow me to walk on land like the rest of you?
Thank you, landstrider. You are the only air breather besides my dearest Sally that has shown me such generosity. I will not lightly forget this.
Do hurry, traveler. Without that device, I will not be able to leave the ever-shrinking confines of this lake.
