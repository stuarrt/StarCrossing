Traveler, I require your assistance in a matter of great importance. The planet is drying up and I will soon have nowhere to go. I wish to move in with Sally, but I cannot survive above the water like she can.
I need you to find some kind of device that I can use to this end.
Thank you, ground walker. It wets my heart to know that you will help two stranded lovers at a crossroads of fate.
Please hurry back soon then, air breather. I shudder to think what may become of me without your help.
