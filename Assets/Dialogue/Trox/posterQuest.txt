Hey Destructor, now that you've gotten used to this place, you need to help me.
When you crashed your ship, my favorite Wallace the ghost frog poster was blown away. You gotta go get it for me.
I saw it fly all the way up to the observatory. I think it's on the top. Just jump up there.
It's just on the observatory, I'm sure someone like yourself can get it no problem
