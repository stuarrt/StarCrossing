Hey there, offworlder
I'm starting to wear down the binding on my brooms with all this monotony. Go grab me some more of Trox's special sauce and I guess I'll compensate you.
Well, then get to it you dainty prude. I can't kill time without some slime.
Listen, kid, I can't do my job without a little slug juice to keep my brooms pushing. Come back soon and I'll send you off.
