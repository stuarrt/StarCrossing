Hello there, surface dweller.
Have you been able to get that strange object out of my cave yet?
Indeed, Sally thought that it might have something to do with your explosive arrival on the planet. Well, thank you stranger. I hope I can call upon you for help in the future.
Do hasten you search, air breather. I do not know how much longer I can hold out without use of my cave during the day. I am nocturnal by nature, after all.
