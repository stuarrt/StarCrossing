Hello there, surface dweller. You must be the traveler that Sally has told me about.
Strange, I thought you would have been... taller. Regardless, there is something that I need you to do for me, are you interested?
Very well, there is an object that fell from the sky some two weeks ago or so. It landed in my cave and has made it inhospitable to my living there. I need you to go down in your protective suit and reclaim the object. You may end up recognizing it.
Well, do return soon, air breather. I would hate for any harm to come to me from the strange object that has turned my cave into a health hazard.
